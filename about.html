        <h3>About the show</h3>
        <p>
          Breaking Bad follows protagonist Walter White (Bryan Cranston), a chemistry teacher who lives in New Mexico with his
          wife (Anna Gunn) and teenage son (RJ Mitte) who has cerebral palsy. White is diagnosed with Stage III cancer and
          given a
          prognosis of two years left to live. With a new sense of fearlessness based on his medical prognosis, and a desire
          to
          secure his family's financial security, White chooses to enter a dangerous world of drugs and crime and ascends to
          power
          in this world. The series explores how a fatal diagnosis such as White's releases a typical man from the daily
          concerns
          and constraints of normal society and follows his transformation from mild family man to a kingpin of the drug
          trade.

        <h3>Los pollos Hermanos</h3>
        <p>Los Pollos Hermanos was a fast-food restaurant chain that specialized in fried chicken operating across the
          southwestern
          United States. The name, pronounced [los ˈpo.ʝos eɾˈma.nos], is ungrammatical Spanish for "The Chicken
          Brothers."
          Founded by Gustavo Fring and Max Arciniega, the restaurant chain had fourteen locations throughout the
          southwest and was
          Gustavo Fring's major business concern. Los Pollos Hermanos was a subsidiary of Madrigal Electromotive, a
          German
          conglomerate with an ownership stake in the company. The restaurant also provided money-laundering and
          logistics for
          illegal activities.</p>
